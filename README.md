# CSC Hacks 2021 Touchless Display Pen Design

## Project Description
* We want to turn Non-Touch Displays into Touchscreens so that you can use devices like your laptop or desktop (with monitor) as a touchscreen to write down notes or edit documents so long as you have a webcam!
* We want to do this because there have been way too many times where we have experienced a need to write something down or edit a document, but did not have a piece of paper or an tablet to write on. As a result, we saw a need to allow users to be able to write on their displays to markup/edit documents or take notes without the need to go and buy an expensive tablet.
* Doing this will/may require learning the following:
* * How to implement Computer Vision
* * How to program in Python
* * Gathering Data from an IMU sensor
* * How to manipulate device peripherals for input/output purposes
* * Syncing/calibration of data between two input streams (IMU and Camera)
* * App Development
* * Communications Technologies (Bluetooth, ZigBee, etc)
* * Working with AR Tags
* * Image/video processing
* * UI development
* * Extensive Debugging/ Prototyping
* * Working/Programming with a team
* We anticipate the following challenges to name a few:
* * Recognizing the Pen using CV in various orientations
* * Syncing data between the Camera and IMU
* * Edge Case Testing (i.e. Pen out of view of camera, AR Tag out of view, etc)
* * Clean/working UI
* * Pen motion tracking for proper movements
* * Getting a working/functional prototype
